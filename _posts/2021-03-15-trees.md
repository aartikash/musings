Trees are very beautiful. 
I have been obssesed with trees since forever that I can remember. 
Back in India, I used to make the Starbucks people write "Tree" as my name 
because I wanted to be a tree. 

Being a tree sounds like so much fun but only in a forest. <br />
If I were a tree I would like to not be uprooted repeatedly by humans. <br /> 
If I were a tree I would stand in the sun and the moon absorbing the sunlight all day everyday. <br />
If I were a tree I would grow my branches long and wide without any fear. <br />
If I were a tree I would make my roots absorb all the nutrients that my branches need. <br />
If I were a tree I would dance in the wind and express myself through the movement of my branches. <br />
If I were a tree I would make sure that my branches spread wide spreading wramth everywhere I go. <br />


Some interesting things that I learned about trees are that they also have consciousness like homo sapiens. 
Trees also have to apparently "fight" for resources to survive. 
They do so through the process of spreading out their roots since roots are the ones that capture enough soil
area so that they can absorb good amounts of minerals. 
When the forests are densely packed, the tree roots overlap each in an attempt to capture as much surface-area
as possible. 

One interesting thing that I noticed in Vancouver was that all trees are planted at certain distance between them. 
My intuition says that is so that: 1) roots have enough surface area to spread out 2) due to (1), it makes it easier 
for humans to move trees to different areas. 
Before moving to Vancouver, I did not know that there is a way to safely uproot trees and move them to different places. 
I do however wonder if the trees feel hurt when they are made to go through this process. 

Another interesting bit about trees is that they release a toxic substance when they feel that they are being attacked in 
some way. 
The substance tends to spread to other trees also and hence the forest as a whole tries to protect itself. :)

Another interesting observation was the connect I found between trees and water. 
The way trees are designed are they have one main branch that can split into two or more main branches and then 
the split keeps continuing repeatedly. Similarly the way water spreads is branches branches and more branches. 

Every time a tree ages, a new layer of branch layer gets developed on the previous layer and that is how one
can also determine the age of the tree. 

Trees really are magnificient creatures.
