Trees are very beautiful. 
I have been obssesed with trees since forever that I can remember. 
Back in India, I used to make the Starbucks people write "Tree" as my name 
because I wanted to be a tree. 

Being a tree sounds like so much fun but only in a forest. <br />
If I were a tree I would like to not be uprooted repeatedly by humans. <br /> 
If I were a tree I would stand in the sun and the moon absorbing the sunlight all day everyday. <br />
If I were a tree I would grow my branches long and wide without any fear. <br />
If I were a tree I would make my roots absorb all the nutrients that my branches need. <br />
If I were a tree I would dance in the wind and express myself through the movement of my branches. <br />
If I were a tree I would make sure that my branches spread wide spreading wramth everywhere I go. <br />
