In my almost 1.5 years of being in grad school, I have noticed very small things that differentiate one researcher from another and it is not the field or the area, it is the drive.

When I entered grad school, I was trying to find the area which interested me, but the sad problem was (still is) everything interested me. I decided to use my master’s as an elimination game for my Ph.D. However, there is a lot more to research than this aspect. According to me, it’s the drive.

The twist in the drive is not only for students but also for professors. It is not about being a hands-on or hands-off professor. Those terms are plain bullshit. Just for context, a hands-on prof is considered the one who is actively involved in your research and a hands-off prof is a term used for profs, who I am not sure why exactly entered the profession of teaching or being a researcher (tenure perhaps?).

When we chose the profession of doing research, it is very important to understand that the learning will never end. It is very important to understand that despite tenure, there will be a gazillion things you will not know and this is not just about knowledge, it’s about problem-solving and yearning to learn from others around you.

A lot of professors after obtaining tenure seem to be losing the drive and love for research. They slowly lose the art of critical thinking and they are more of a liability than a useful entity in an institution. So a question that I ask myself is, shouldn’t this be looked into? Shouldn’t there be some quality checks which must be conducted after regular intervals to ensure that there is some decent drive left in the professors in a research-driven institute?

It seems to me that a lot of professors who lose their research drive after tenure are bringing down the entire existence of good research institutes. It’s ok to not have a research vison (like I will still be able to handle that) but what is even worse than that is when you no longer possess the ability to think and question things critically. You might think that - is that a skill which can be lost if not practiced? From my general observation (of a very small data sample) I believe yes. If you have read Siddhartha by  Hermann Hesse, it shows siddhartha’s journey where his three skills for the longest time were patience, fasting, and thinking. However, after getting involved in the “human” life, he not only lost those abilities, he had to undergo an entirely different process to be able to achieve them all over again successfully. Similarly, I believe, it is ok to not hold a student’s hand during her research, it is ok to not provide them with direct problem statements to start working with, but what is really important is to listen to them and critique their ideas and research. However, once you lose that ability, after tenure, I doubt that it is possible to ever get it back. I feel sorry for such people from the depth of my heart.

There is a choice which everyone has to make when they chose to do research, they need to understand, there is never any form of “stability” which the general audience strives for. When I mean stability ofc after tenure there is the stability, but is that the reason you really got into research? That after you are 40 you’d have job security? When you start research, you learn and you grow and you learn some more.

The drive to learn and research should never die. I’d like to point out again that the drive to learn is different from providing exact problem statements and solutions to students. These are two different things.

Moral: The drive to do research (if you have chosen to become a prof.) should not die despite the fact that you are 20,30,40,50 or 60 years old.
