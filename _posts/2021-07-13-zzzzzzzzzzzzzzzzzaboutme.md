For some reason, this is the happiest I have been since the 
past n years. 

In general though I am mostly a happy human, but this is 
like the epitome. 

OK, I think Jan'20- Early May'20 also I was very happy
with some crappy things in the middle but mostly i was happy. 

I am back into learning everything in moderation mode again. 

I am back, FINALLY!
I think not back, I am ME finally. 

This is my most fav version of me. MEEE

I love me so much. OMG. :') 


Who knew a covid vaccine and high fever where I literally could not move was all I needed. 

OK but for real the fever was wierd, even after two tablets it did not go away. 







Fin.
