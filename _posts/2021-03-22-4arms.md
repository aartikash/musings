So I was watching a series "Violet Evergarden" that my best friend suggested I watch. 
He is a very cool guy so I decided to take his suggestion for a change. 

Anyway, the main character in the series "Violet" has metal arms and she has serviced 
in miltary her entire life and does not understand emotions. 
This above data was mostly unnecessary except for the metal arms part. 

Seeing her use her metal arms a question came in my mind which was, What would I do if I 
had four arms, two the ones that I already have and two metal arms.

Answer: It is not a very easy question, since some other questions I need to answer before I can answer this 
question are:

    Q1: Do my two new arms appear suddenly?
    Q2: Do I have prior training when I am using these arms?
    Q3: Would the movement of these two new arms be independent of my previous arms?
    Q4: Which metal would those arms be constructed of?


So after writing the above questions I realised that I do not care about the answers to 
any of the questions above. 

The reason is the question I am trying to answer is in terms of everyday life what would I 
do with four arms given there are no restrictions on the powers of the arms. 

My final answer is: I would do the same things that I do but with four arms instead of two. 

The lesson here: Sometimes answers are easier than they seem to be and should not be over complicated. 

Bye my friends. Thanks for reading. Hope this helped.
