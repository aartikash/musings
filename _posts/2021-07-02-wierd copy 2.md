So we got new tenants for our old house a couple of weeks back 
and we had to sort of redo the house before giving it to them. 

The general suggestion was to atleast get the house painted. 

I suggested that maybe since I am so free and pretty much jobless 
these days, I should perhaps paint the house. 

My mom was not much convinced with my sell. 

So because she did not let me paint the old house, I decided to paint
every wooden shelf in current house. 

I am still working on it. 

I am not sure how its going to end up but I am very hopeful. 

Good luck to me from another version of me.
