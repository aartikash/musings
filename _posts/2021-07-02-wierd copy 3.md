So this time when I returned to India, I was feeling a bit too 
connected to India, probably because I have not visited India in 
2 years. 

Anyway, so to feel that connection, I decided to start learning
singing pure Hindustani classical music. 

It was interesting that I ended up very quickly and without effort 
finding a teacher who is world renowned and has learned from world's 
best musicians. 

Now I am learning how to sing pure classical music, the diffeerence is 
in pure classsical music we sing notes and their different combinations 
rather than the song itself. 

I am also entering a competition where the first round is in Kolkata and the 
second round is in Russia. 

I am very excited. 

I think music also helps me do my research better.
