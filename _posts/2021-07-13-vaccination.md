The first time I went for vaccination was
around two months back. 

It was in a pretty big hospital in Mumbai and 
i doubt i will ever forget what happened. 

So when I went in, they asked me my age and said 
yes yes go in, we don't have dose 1 but we can 
give you dose 2. 

I think this is the day when I finally decided to 
run.
