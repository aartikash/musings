This helped me remember why i enjoy research. Thank you old Aarti from current Aarti. 

I feel I should have asked this before. The answer is not too difficult. It was right in front of me, but blinded by the things I wanted to achieve and the things the materialistic world put out in front of me, I never asked this question before.

Time is passing too quickly. Every day I wake up, do my work, spend time avoiding people I don't feel comfortable with. During the effort being invested (mostly subconscious) in avoiding the people I feel discomfort or negative around, I finally asked this question, was I lucky enough to be surrounded by positive people, would I have felt better. - Yes definitely.

I don't believe people are good or bad, it's just that sometimes, you just get negative vibes from some of them. It is natural and it is nobody's fault, but, it is important to escape from that environment and situation.

I would like to be surrounded by people who are passionate about what they do.  I don't care if the passion is pottery or farming, it's just about pure eagerness and passion. There is always a lot to learn from people who are passionate about their work. Another thing I have noticed is that people who are sincerely passionate about an area ooze out positive energy. It's not a competition for them anymore. Whereas, people who are doing their work to prove something or show something to the world, always have hints of negativity about them.  

I would like to be surrounded by people, who possess the ability to develop empathy for situations where required.

I would like to be surrounded by people who are not malicious.

I would like to be surrounded by people who do not see other people as entities just because they are superior in the societal made fictional hierarchies.

The more I love my research, the less competitive and more content I become. Hence, surrounding myself with people who make me feel discomfort I leave. It is better to spend time alone than spend it with people who create bad vibes. Life is too short to feel like shit at any point. :)

Fin.
