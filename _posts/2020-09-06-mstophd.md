For the past two months, I have been sort of in a lump where I have been unable to read the sort of books or literature that I usually read such as Franz Kafka or Dostoyevsky or any book that I feel is remotely human. I have been reading books that give me “knowledge” of some sort or are answering some questions that I have been pondering over for my technical understanding. Honestly, I have been feeling quite robotic lately and that makes me feel  … well duh nothing? Didn’t I just say I felt robotic?  

So I asked myself a very simple question: what was it about the books that I read on regular basis such as “The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde” that made me feel umm … not robotic? This book has been my favourite read of the year 2019. The reason was that the book had so much character and the way it depicted how a man perceives suffering was so superficial yet so deep (this statement is something only people who have read it will understand). The point was that when I read such books it helps me develop a little more empathy and compassion towards people around me and helps me understand the world a little better.

Reading such books also really makes me understand how superficial the “achievements” as deemed by our society really are. I don’t understand the point of comparing our materialistic contributions to society with other humans to feel greatness. When I say this I don’t mean to say that I don’t like to work, I do indeed (well depending on what the work is!) but that does not mean that I let any piece of work define me or anyone else’s worth in society.

Another interesting aspect to notice is that humans interact with other humans based on the similarity they feel with them or how the rest of society will perceive that interaction. In the past one month, the deepest and meaningful in-person conversation that I have had has been with my school’s cleaning man who has been keeping our labs tidy for as long as I can remember being in UBC. The conversation with him was so honest and unadulterated which made me feel good in a way that I cannot really explain.

That is when I realized due to the minimal in-person interactions that I have been having lately have actually turned me a little mechanical which is sort of boring. I mean everyone can work and get things done. That is when the books and literature that I read came to my rescue and connect me with things that actually give me a little more life. Reading about a story such as Dorian Gray where the man so beautiful is scared of losing his youth does things that are just unexplainable is so interesting to read. It helps one see what humans are willing to do to hide and cover their insecurities, but from who? -- the world? --where everyone is literally doing the same things? When one starts asking such questions, then the materialistic things become so unimportant that the need for something is more from curiosity than it is from the desire to be rich, famous, and popular. Reading such books also helps me see things in a way that I cannot really explain since when I read books I develop images of these characters in my head. This is much different from watching standard series (again, I am not saying that don’t watch series because the amount of television I have consumed is incomparable) since here I use my own imagination guided by the writer to construct scenarios which ignite a part of my brain that watching standard tele stuff does not.

The point is the benefits of reading books that just flow are multiple: materialistic things don’t concern me so much, I get to see things in a way that gives me more life in my day to day activities even the trivial ones, I get to spend my time in a way that I enjoy it and the characters I meet in my books are quite wonderful really (even the bad ones).
