Since after my vaccination dose I have been lying sick since the 
past two days, barely can move, 
I have decided to start writing poems to express my pain 
regarding my condition. 

This is a poem dedicated to me by me for my pain:

The days are long and yet they are short
The nights are cool yet they make me drool 

The pain does not seem to go away 
The tablet does not do the deed

Hence, my hope is the words, words from the depth of my soul 
will help ease the suffering and pain I am in right now. 





Fin.
