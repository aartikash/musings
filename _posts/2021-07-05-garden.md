So when I finally came back to India, there were
a 100 things I wanted to do. 

So my house in India is pretty neat, unlike the small 
clautrophobic apartments in North America that are there. 

So in my first year, I used to stay in a studio and when my 
mom visited me she was so affected that she decided to buy 
a house for me in Vancouver so that i don't have to live in 
such a tiny apartment. lol. 

Anyway, I managed to convince her and my grandparents that 
its ok and I can survive. 

So, my house in India has this huge terrace that is equivalent to 
the size of the house. 

I decided to utilise it by building my own garden there. 

Now, we have an amazing collection of plants. 

The plants that we have are:
1. Green chilli
2. Lemon
3. Hibiscus
4. Tulsi (or basil)
5. Neem (This is my fav, its not available in North America)
6. Lemon grass
7. Mogra
8. Papaya
9. Mint
10. Three more plants who have amazing scents 

My initial goal was to setup medicianl garden so I can 
you know heal humans with my herbs. 
But then I realised my presence is enough to heal people 
and I don't need more tools. 

Hence, i decided to include more plants in my mix. 

So now, I sit on my jute swing in my terrace and enjoy my 
time with my plants. 

We are very happy together. 

Lesson: Having your own garden is awesome!
