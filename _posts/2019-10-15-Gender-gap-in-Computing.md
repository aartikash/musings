The gender gap in computing sciences is a real thing. I am not going to give instances of the men-women ratios or give any instances where women are treated badly. All such information is available in abundance on the internet. My insight here is quite small - it’s the fact that the people are unaware that they do this.

It’s not about ignorance, it’s about indifference. Assuming that a human is capable enough to earn a Ph.D. in a field like Computer Science, you can assume that they are aware that this gap exists (if not, that’s amusing). However, the main problem lies in the existence of subconscious bias. They don’t realize that they do this.

Let’s take a hypothetical scenario, there are 5 lilies and in the family of 5 lilies a rose enters one fine morning. It is alone there and it has not many roses around it. The lilies share similar routine patterns where they “talk” and “eat” together. However, despite spotting the rose, nobody ever includes the rose. Rose tries a couple of times but the lilies are so involved in their own little world that they fail to notice that the rose is actually taking effort.  Most of the time, Rose’s opinions or concerns are not even considered (democracy much). After a point, the rose gets fed up with trying. So the rose chooses to leave that area in order to find a home with other roses and goes and speaks to the head flower.

There are two obvious problems here:
The lilies (obviously)
But the even bigger problem lies in the head of the flower committee

A child learns from the behaviour it observes around it (in most cases). Similarly, a lily is highly influenced by the head flower around it. This is a chain because someday in the future the lilies are going to be given the status of the head of the flower and the pattern is going to repeat. The probability of the rose becoming the head flower in the future is only (1\6). Hence, this is going to repeat (unless ofc in some corner case scenario). Here, the head flower is a human and if it fosters a more inclusive environment then the lilies and roses can live in harmony.

For the outer world, the distinction is not visible but only the rose understands what is happening. The lilies are in their own world because in terms of the ideal laws they are not mistreating the rose, are they?

But again I am not saying that the lilies are bad. Perhaps, if the situation was reversed, the lily would have been the victim.

Moral: The gap is not because of the lilies treating the rose badly or vice versa, it’s just that the quantities and representative samples determine a lot of things.
