Today after a long time I am feeling very excited about life. 

I think for the past one year I have felt very trapped with the 
energies around me. 

I think it was my own fault, I trusted some energies that perhaps 
I should not have, that too, repeatedly. 

Unfortunately, I think that took everything from me, but I think 
it also gave me ME.  

Due to the stuff going on, I was able to realise what things I 
don't personally entertain in my life anymore. 

I was also able to set firm boundaries. 

Most of all that I have realised is that I literally cannot be 
in a place where everything is a competition instead of seeing 
everyone grow and progress in life. 
This is sort of very sad and depressing for me. 

When I entered my PhD the one thing I was excited about was 
working with humans who enjoyed research.

Anyway, what is done is done. 
I know that I really deep inside enjoy programming, working on research, 
building and creating new things that can help humans. 


Fin.
