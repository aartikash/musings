Last I updated my Goodreads was Jan 10th which means that 
thats when I last read a book of any sort or rather completed 
a book of any sort. 

Finally, I thought of reading a book today but the problem is 
none of the books match my taste. 
Nothing on my kindle, my ipad or physical copies are alluring me 
at the moment. 

So what do I want to read?
I know I do want to read something but... I am being very cautious of 
the content I consume these days. 
So...

This is so confusing. 

Ok, so the sort of books that I DONT want to read are:
1. Non fiction books (especially anything related to STEM)
2. Human centric books (I don't think I can read such books for a long time for now.)
3. Fiction (?) -- Maybe but what in fiction
5. No world issues books please
4. No books on stuff of any sort 


Man this is difficult. 
This is very difficult. 

Maybe it is time to give up reading "books"....


Fin.
