Just some grad school rantings -2

<!--more-->

When you enter the world of being a grad student “trying” to make your mark by doing research you realize it’s a lot of work. You can read all the “how to get a PhD” books, however, your experience is YOUR experience. Don’t expect the books to have all the answers. While pursuing my undergrad from India, the most difficult thing perhaps for me was imagining how do people write such amazing papers (Trust me I was all head over heels over these research papers). However, as my grad studies progressed, for me doing research was not the complicated aspect. Perhaps the most complicated part of this entire process is convincing someone, as to why this is “novel” and why is it required.

One fact remains unchanged, be it the States, India or Tokyo, nobody really cares about what you do. Hence, you not only need to do world class research but convince people to hear you talk. A small thing which I noticed in the past few months is that nobody actually listens to you. Everyone has their own story in the back of the head and perhaps after hearing a familiar word they relate the entire talk to how they think instead of hearing out your story. I am not pointing fingers or bitching about people but think about it, it’s a very natural tendency for humans to not hear you talk(we are self-centred).

 Even if you are doing world class research in your area, there is a very high probability, that in a room full of 100 people, we probably lose 70 after we are done with the introduction of our work, We lose the next 20 towards the methodology and by the end we are wrapping, we are lucky if there is even a single person in the entire audience, who was actually listening.(IKR?!)

So what can we do about it? - WRITE! I would say write your heart out. If you feel there is any small aspect of things that people might not understand, then perhaps point to links explaining those topics really well. The best part about writing is, it’s a more clear means of communication(at-least for me). As the topic starts becoming more and more clear, creating analogies for different people with different backgrounds starts becoming more and more fun. I love relating everything to everything. For example the way I see my area is one huge blob of same underlying structure with different names and terminologies(more on this later).

In order to not having the trouble to explain everything from scratch every-time you have a conversation chose one set of research community and stick with it. This does make me wonder how the researchers contributing to interdisciplinary fields survive. There are so many layers of abstractions in different fields that it becomes really difficult to communicate at times.

I am hoping that by the end of my graduate studies I will be able to communicate better and convey my thoughts in a more precise sense and hopefully will or will not have different opinions on writing and speaking.
