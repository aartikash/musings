description: How I learned my lesson and concluded that it is important to talk.

There are multiple types of graduate students and professors I encountered in the past year. Some talk all the time - yet their points are not very juicy.  Some never speak up during the duration of the live discussion, yet have some wonderful points stacked up inside their heads.  Some speak once during the entire discussion, usually towards the end and provide a brief overview. One question is - What is the appropriate amount that I (a graduate student) must speak or ask questions?

The answer is quite simple. It should not matter what anyone perceives of me. There will always be a bunch of people who exist to judge my points. However, the question I ask myself is - Will letting this point out help in my learning? Initially, there was always a small fear instilled in me, where I felt that if my points are not up to my audience's standards, I will be judged. I noticed that this was hindering my growth as a researcher.  After realizing that, it did not matter to me whether my points were good or bad. If I don't let out my points, they will perhaps never be cleared. The subtle doubt of confusion can lead to bigger research problems in the future(ever heard of the butterfly effect?).  An example is - being a security researcher, I once asked in a reading group what is security by obscurity. The term was mentioned by one of the students during a discussion.  The reaction I received was not very positive. However, after obtaining the answer, the only winner was me - I now knew what the term meant.

It is very important to ask questions, especially as a graduate student. I realized the only time I don't have questions is when I am not listening. The more I hear, the more I think and process and the more questions I have.  The reading groups or the discussions I attend are for me and my learning. If I don't make mistakes by asking "stupid" questions, I am not fulfilling my motive to attend the groups and discussions. In turn, I am wasting my time.

In conclusion, if a graduate student knows her motives well, then the answer to the above question becomes very obvious.
