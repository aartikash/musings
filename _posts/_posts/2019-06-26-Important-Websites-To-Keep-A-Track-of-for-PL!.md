description: A List of PL Blogs to keep a track of

This post is for my own personal benefit. There are numerous people
posting technical and non-technical stuff related to what's going on in Programming Languages.

There are a number of people working on different aspects of Programming languages such as using semantics abstractions for equivalence checking for compiler optimizations, some on formalizing memory models, some on types and some on differential dynamic logic for defining programming languages.
