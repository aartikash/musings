description: A short story on why research attracts me.

Just some grad school rantings -1

As a student, being in the field of technology, honestly, there are a lot of different directions to pursue. For some people it's probably money, for others it the need to learn and for the rest it's probably fate that got them involved in this field.

However, for me I decided to pursue graduate studies for the eventual independence I might get in the future(still hopeful). Also, I was not satisfied with my undergraduate studies. I wanted to learn and understand more.

Since, I started my graduate studies, things have changed for me at an exponential rate. Before starting my graduate studies, I honestly liked all areas. I was open to explore all the subjects. Interestingly, that aspect did not change. However, a couple of different things did change considerably that made me understand that limiting my scope is very important.

The type of research which I do want to pursue is something that is challenging for me. Hence, I decided to make a set of question which help me conclude if that is something I am interested in doing. As a grad student, there is a huge scope out there to learn and understand new and cool things.

    Q1: Will it help me learning something new and interesting?
    Q2: Is it challenging enough?
    Q3: Is this research impactful?

1. Interesting is a really abstract word. However, in order to be excited about something new and interesting, a topic should be a challenging. Sometimes, some things can require a lot of implementation details and yet not be novel in some respect. Also, pursuing a particular problem statement lead to exploration of multiple other domains which is fulfilling.

Also, by novelty I do not mean something completely new and out of the box. The quote below explains it all.

        If you want to get published, then heed this advice:
        Cite your friends at least once and your enemies twice,
        The editor three times, yourself at least four,
        And write in a style that's intended to bore.
        If you want to get published, here's what you must do
        Above all: don't come up with anything new.

                                                Joel E. Cohen


2. There are multiple open research questions out there in the world. We cannot solve them all. As a graduate student and hopefully a researcher some day, picking a challenging problem statement is a very important process. The goal should not be to solve the problem, but, to build a direction for solving it and learning a lot in the process. Also, if it is something that anyone out there can do, is it then worth doing? I do not want to be the one to be doing so.

3. Finally, apart from being challenging, it should be useful for some category of people. Maybe other researchers, or perhaps developers or even users. But, as a student, we should definitely have this aspect in the back of our heads, however, in my current opinion it is not absolutely necessary. As a student, I want to understand and learn , however, in this process it is not always a going to be the case where I end up making an impactful contribution.

These are my thoughts after 9 months in the graduate school. The experience for every student is different. My friends who started their graduate journeys around the same time I did, have a completely different vision of their goals.
