I am a super-reader (modesty at it’s best). At least that is what I like to believe about myself. I might be an average student, average speaker and probably in general an average human but I have always prided myself in being such an intense reader.

As a computer science student, I have often noticed that a lot of students in this area love science fiction(I do not have any stats, but it’s my observation and it might be completely wrong). I used to love it too. My fav science fiction novel perhaps is ‘The moon is a harsh mistress’. It was way-way ahead of its time but I guess that is what science fiction is about. When I came to Vancouver I was introduced to William Gibson who is popular in the science fiction world for coining the term ‘cyberpunk’. However, to my dismay, when I started reading his books, I realized, how much I DO NOT ENJOY science fiction.

I realized that it annoys me. So I decided to understand why that is so? Usually, I just decide to like or dislike things/places/humans and I don’t care about the reason behind such emotions. However, not liking a particular genre of books was a pretty surprising revelation for me. So I started looking at some of the “science fiction” novels which I had read recently. This is when I started looking back at what aspects of those novels were not enjoyable for me.

One of the reasons was when they talk about such high tech gadgets and make stories based on that, I tend to relate it to the reality of such systems. Maybe, it’s just an opinion, but I really find it a bit too exaggerated and a lot of times non-sensical. I mean I understand that’s why it’s called fiction, but for some reason, it gets to me. Another reason is that usually, these science fiction novels have a common tendency to cite some real-world examples like Tesla. In Origin by Dan Brown, the main character mentions Elon musk and his teslas which becomes a part of the story and this annoys me further. It’s supposed to be fiction right? Then why are you relating it to the real aspects of the world? I mean what are you trying to do. Either write a fiction novel or write a non-fiction one. Why are you confusing the reader(MEE!!) so much? Maybe, for a lot of people, they enjoy this stuff in fiction work and probably like the fact that the author is trying to relate it to what the general audience would understand. (Coz doesn’t everyone just have this need to be accepted somewhere? - but again a separate topic).

This is when I decided to segregate my likings into different categories of genres. While categorizing my favourite books I realized, I don’t follow the genre, I follow the authors. I have a pattern, if I like an author and his/her writing style, I will read all of their work and not just the popular one. This is because I am interested in knowing more about their thought process.

This when I created a short list for myself. Obviously, it is not complete or comprehensive, but it helped me understand myself better. Also, I am pretty sure, the next time when I try segregating my favourite work, the list would have changed considerably.

Top authors (Tier -1) - Kafka, Murakami, Orwell and Virginia Woolf
            (Tier -2) - Dostoevsky, J.D Salinger
            (Tier -3) - Tolstoy

So the fact that I don't really care about the genre was a huge realization for me. This has always been the case, I have never cared about the topic (so long it’s not a cheesy love story) since I like every topic(not kidding, I like learning/reading about every topic). Hence, it was a surprise for me when I thought that I do not enjoy science fiction. It’s perhaps not that I do not enjoy science fiction, I might not actually be enjoying the writing style.
This created another question for me, which was - What sort of authors do I really like?

The reason I love Kafka is because his work is so abstract it gets me thinking, I don’t really understand what I think about but it takes me from my current environment and leaves me in some other space. His stories are not based on one particular theme but they are just super abstract. I really wish that someday I can write like Kafka. Even, his two-page stories are beautiful to read. There are so many meanings yet there are none. There are these weird unexpected twists which make me go like what? There is suspense. How does he do it? How does he manage to write so well???????

So maybe if Kafka was writing science fiction, I would have probably enjoyed it. It’s not the genre’s fault I guess. Currently, my love for Kafka is so intense that I am learning French so that I can read the original work written by him and not the English translated work. I feel a lot is lost in the translation process, but that ranting is for some other day.

Fin.
