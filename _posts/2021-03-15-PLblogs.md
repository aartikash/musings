I think the two things I enjoy the most are: observing and connecting things. 
That is why I like to document the things that I come across so that perhaps 
other humans entering the research field can benefit from these things someday.

This is small experiences of writing code in Racket and some experience reports
that might benefit some humans.

Some collection of papers that describe the process of going from Assembly to 
Hardware.

A PL dictionary for some words that I really found very confusing. 

- <a href="https://github.com/aartikash/A-Theory-of-Microarchitecture" target="_top">A Theory of Microarchitecture</a>

Some things that I write to develop a new theory of microarchitecture, 
that I am interested in learning about.

A blog where I post short reviews of the papers that I read.
