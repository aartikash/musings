I think the two things I enjoy the most are: observing and connecting things. 
That is why I like to document the things that I come across so that perhaps 
other humans entering the research field can benefit from these things someday. 

- <a href="https://github.com/aartikash/Programming-in-Racket" target="_top">Programming in Racket</a>

This is small experiences of writing code in Racket and some experience reports
that might benefit some humans. 

- <a href="https://github.com/aartikash/Assembly-to-Hardware" target="_top">Assembly to Hardware</a>

Some collection of papers that describe the process of going from Assembly to 
Hardware. 

- <a href="https://github.com/aartikash/PL-Wordfinder/blob/main/README.md" target="_top">PL Wordfinders</a>

A PL dictionary for some words that I really found very confusing. 

- <a href="https://github.com/aartikash/A-Theory-of-Microarchitecture" target="_top">A Theory of Microarchitecture</a>

Some things that I write to develop a new theory of microarchitecture, 
that I am interested in learning about.

This is of course the blog where this article is being written at.
