<!--more-->


Recently, I submitted a paper to a music and computer science conference. 
The key insights that I wanted to add to the work were that 
by constructing the most basic musical notes in form of a tool we can 
actually construct the most complex and complicated of the musical combinations. 

However, the thing that happened here was that i explained it a bit too well. 

Lesson here: Explain well like you do Aarti then in the next pass add complexity to it
but introducing more and more jargons. 

Fin.
