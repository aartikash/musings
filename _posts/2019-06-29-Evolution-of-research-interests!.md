Why are my interests evolving at an exponential phase?

It’s a super interesting phenomenon that I have recently started noticing in myself . Since I have started my grad studies my interests - academic or otherwise have been evolving at a super-exponential phase.

Being a super-hungry person for knowledge as well as food (hehe) since forever, this should not be a surprise, however, this is at a much faster phase than even I can imagine.

Research aspect: When I started my research I was pretty sure I want to build, break and re-build systems. I imagined myself to be this super cool system administrator. I won’t lie or try to be modest but in my undergrad years I was known as this ‘operating system chic’. I can’t recall the exact emotions at this phase, however, I do remember I used to sit all night trying to fix different systems applications trying to run them on beagle-bones or other micro-controllers. There was a time when I had almost 10 operating systems installed on my oh-not-so-good laptop just to test out a couple of nonsense(?) stuff. So, obviously, I was pretty confident that this is something I enjoy and should pursue my graduate studies in.

But, life is very unpredictable - rather life is super predictable, I am quite unpredictable. I took these courses in my grad school and suddenly something changed. I am not sure when and how this transition took place, but I realized I want to do something which I am not good at. I will not lie, I barely attended any lectures in undergrad. I was unaware of the endless possibilities out there in the CS world. Perhaps in grad school, it was the first time in my life I was eager to attend lectures. I was the first bencher in my grad school courses (personality switch much?). Anyway, taking my first interdisciplinary course on formal methods, I immediately felt this deep connection with that subject. It felt like we are supposed to be together. I saw a light there. At that moment I did not care how much I sucked at it, I just wanted it. I cannot explain how beautiful understanding that subject felt. I am sure I cried a couple of times (not literal tears - heart tears, duh!). I did not care about any other subject or any other thing at that point of time and knew that is what I am going to do for my entire life (planning much?). Anyway, just testing and building systems and looking at numbers became a little less interesting and this overshadowed my love for systems. I mean obviously, I understand that testing systems are a super integral part of the research, but I liked the thinking aspect before the blind testing aspect. I mean, for me imagining scenarios and corner cases and relating different layers of abstractions in systems became more interesting.

When you are from a country like India, despite a “decent enough” university and despite the numerous MOOCs, there was so so so much that I did not know. I had built my assumptions and most of them matched the real thing, however, there were certain things I did not even consider for instance that verification could be such a beautiful blend between systems and theory. The fact that verification will give me the chance to not only play around with systems but also think in terms of abstractions. Calculus and other math stuff existence started making sense. This is when I decided to take grad courses completely out of my comfort zone, and this is when I was introduced to the world of programming languages. (Oh! How beautiful was it?).

This is when I started understanding a little more about these different areas of research out there. For doing systems-level research minimal background is enough to get you started, however, to contribute to something as deep as programming languages, you need some background building, though the undergrad courses are good enough to get you started (my case was a little different because I literally never attended any lectures in my undergrad!).

Anyway, after this shoooooooort (a pun on the long short-haha) journey of 9 months, I am super unsure of what I want to do (expected something better? - oops). However, I realized this one thing, it’s super important to explore as much as you can in your masters so that you make the right choice for your Ph.D. I mean I know it’s said nobody ever reads your thesis. But, I will probably read my thesis at least 100 times (narcissist since a kid). I don’t want to find mistakes in my work when I am perhaps reading it for the 19th or the 37th time. I want it to feel awesome whenever I re-read my thesis. Despite nobody reading it, I am doing it for myself, not for my neighbours or my cat (hypothetical, I am a turtle person), but you get the point right?

I realized this one thing, no matter what anyone says, if I am not enjoying what I am doing, I would rather not do it. This is how I think and if I am not convinced I will just not do it. Trust me I am not trying to sound arrogant here, this is how I have always been as far as I can remember about myself. After 23 years of existence, you can’t expect a persons’ nature to change, can you?

Also, if I wanted to work according to someone else’s will and someone else’s project,  I would have not considered grad studies, I would have probably considered a job (never gonna happen, I don’t think I will ever work xP). I mean ofc I want to align my interests with my mentors (that is super duper imp.) but not at the cost of my own existence and happiness (sorry!).

Anyway, my point is, interests are going to evolve but after a point, you will start connecting the dots. Everything is connected. Verification is for systems, for finding bugs, etc which required you to build, break and abstract the systems. Programming languages theory gives you the ability to abstract stuff and formalize it. Do you see my point? Despite an outsider might think, man, she shifts a lot and yes perhaps I do but everything connects!!!. I will have to write at least 10 other articles to explain how I see this but the point is everything is connected man!

Hence, I feel glad I decided to attend graduate school. My interests are evolving I don’t use the word changing, I use evolving. Just to ensure everyone’s on the same page as me.

Changing - This means a complete shift without any trace of the previous entity. For example: Using an iPad pro instead of Lenovo ThinkPad series.

Evolving - This means small change with the previous entity still a part of the new entity. For example: moving from Lenovo Yoga Series X to Yoga series X with some new features and perhaps a graphics card.

NOTE: Maybe for someone else, there is no difference between evolving and changing but hey, my life, my meanings, my blog, I can write what I think :D

Hence, maybe people think I am changing, but, hey, I see myself as evolving. I don’t forget my roots and my previous work. I feel a little sad when I see everyone categorizing their work :(. I mean I understand they have to, right? But why make it so mechanical and robotic. I like things flowy, mixed and connected. But well I hate categorizations in general (music, art wtv).

My point is, you just need to force yourself to see the connection really strongly, for your most interesting topics to come together. Trust me the connection exists. It does!!!!!!!!! I believe so strongly in that notion. Finally, keep evolving and exploring and evolving a little more. Don’t stop. This is the right age to explore and make mistakes (I make so many, that the internet might run out of space if I start listing them)  before we become old and frail and die.

Fin.
