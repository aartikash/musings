<!--more-->


It is finally time. 

For those following my musings, must be well aware that 
I am a computer science nerd. 
This means that I now need a read nerdy blog, I have two 
before this but I think I deleted them or something. 
Anyway, finally I think I am ready... weeeeeeee

So the question is: what template must I use?

1. I have been very much inclined towards pollen which is built in 
Racket and it has a very dope book types feels. 
2. The other option I have is Frog which is a static blog generator 
in Racket again. 
3. The next option that I have is umm... I can perhaps use Rocket, the 
Rust framework. 
4. Or maybe I can use the same template that I use for musings. 

I think I would like to keep my musings and my tech stuff seperate for now. 
It might be better that way. 

I don't think everyone will understand my deep musings. 
My tech stuff will be much more easier to understand than my metaphoric 
messages here. 

I will update the new blog post link here soon. :)

Let us see which template wins the battle of templates for being 
my blog template. 
Good luck to all of you!

Fin.
