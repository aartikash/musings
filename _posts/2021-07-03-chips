So like any other day, today I went out to get
some stuff for my fire stuff. 

And I decided to buy some chips along the way, 

It is so interesting to observe that in the midst of the
pandemic, where everything here mostly closes by 4 because of the 
curfew, this chips shop was open. 

Something about that shop made me go a long route and come back all the 
way for some reason. 

So anyway, I bought 5 different packet of chips (ragi, plain, banana and two more). 

Sometimes it is very wierd to see Mumbai so shut. 
All shutters are down just like in those pandemic movies and flyers on the roads. 

And then there stands out this one chips shop, ready to save the day for humans 
like me I think. 

The other interesting bit about the shop was the variety, 
These days I am noticing that most shops have reduced their items 
and are selling only the required stuff. 

However, this chips shop had like 50 different types of chips
and all of them looked sooper fresh. 

Anyway, I enjoyed my chips with cha. 

Lesson: Always be observent because that one thing might just be open.
