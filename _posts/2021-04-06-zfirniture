I have liked to cook food ever since I was a kid. Cook and eat both. 

Staying in India, of course I learned to master Indian cusine which 
has too many styles. Too many for a small ameture blog post to explain. 
(Please google for those intereste and don't know what I am talking about)

Anyway, so when I moved to Canada, I tried out couple of other things, 
that is when I realised that I can literally switch to any cusine because 
I am so good at cooking at Indian food. 

Ok, to give some examples, 

One of the most difficult things to master in Indian cooking is a round 
chappati. I think in time I learned how to make my rotis in less than ten 
minutes daily. 

Now for someone who has mastered the art of making dough and round proper rotis 
making breads, their dough from scratch, making pie base, making pizza base 
all these things become completely trivial. 

I won't lie though I had to work very hard to master the art of making proper
chappatis and making my roti dough especially because I use high fibre atta. 

Another example is, the pulses (or dals), black beans and all such things, 
require a very specific flavouring. 
And I think I have mastered those flavourings which enables me to also 
make amazing mexican food. 

Also, I am specifically talking about vegetarian stuff. 

So I can give many many more examples, but I think my point here is conveyed
which is that due to the extreme variety and flavourings in Indian food, once 
it is mastered, every other cusine becomes trivial. 

Now, I can be wrong about it but I personally have managed to translate my 
skills to Mexican, Thai, North American baking stuff pretty quickly 
and I think I should be able to cook pretty much anything (so long it is vegetarian.


Lesson: Sometimes we don't need to put in extra effort to learn a new topic, we 
already perhaps know it, it is all about connecting things in the head. 

Fin.
