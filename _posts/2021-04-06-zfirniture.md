Today I feel like writing about the mental illness especially in 
context of academia. 
Though before I write about it one thing I have realised after 
several discussions with my friends who are NOT in academia is that
the problem seems to exist in almost every work place. 

Some context here, when I began my PhD, I honestly did not believe 
that I was going to go through what I went through. 

The thing about mental illness is that it creeps up on in an 
insidious way. When it really hits you, you don't really know that 
it has hit you. 
You might start realising that something is not quite right but 
knowing exactly what that is is not completely understood. 

The worst bit that can happen about these mental illness is that 
they hit you and you don't really realise that they have hit you. 
Yet they hit you. 

It is also very easy to fool oneself that they are actually 
non-existant. 
It is very easy to keep fooling yourself especially if you 
have trust issues to add on to this on top of that. 

I think when my mental health went for a toss, I did not 
have any idea how to approach it. 
The thing was being raised in India, mental health is never 
given any importance. 

The worst bit is when you are going through it, it becomes 
very difficult to actually verbalise it in any way. 

I think the reason I am able to talk about it is because 
I had three major breakdowns in the middle where I did 
stuff that I would never ideally do. 

Sometimes, when you do those things, you are not even in 
control anymore. 
The worst bit is you can see you are mucking up but you 
do it anyway. 

I think at times like this it is good to surround one 
with people who might see or understand your condition 
before you do and perhaps tell it to you. 

I had great people around me but my mental illness prevented me 
from taking or understanding how to take help from anyone. 

I think some things I have realised after this is:
1. Always keep a checklist of things that are constant for you 
irrespective of what or where you are in your life. 
If this list is violated in some way, understand you need to
go to someone for help. 

2. Keep atleast 2-3 humans around you that actively understand 
mental health and know you well so that when you have your breakdowns, 
they can help or assist you so that you do not mess up things for yourself.

3. Try to keep your personal and work life seperate (if possible) and if point 
1 has been violated immediately seek leave from your workplace before you do 
more damage. 

4. At any given point in your life, ensure you prioritise your mental health 
and other health over everything else. 

5. Try and find things that you like doing and enjoy doing at any point in life, 
so that when you know that something is going down, those two three things that 
you are passionate about can save you, for me, it was my music and my research 
that perhaps helped me survive during that time. 

I think the worst bit about this is sometimes we do not even understand the 
reason behind why things are going all bad. 

In a materialistic sense, everything around can seem to be completely fine, 
however, it might not be the case. 

SO when this happens, understanding the core and the root cause is what causes 
the biggest issue. 

Sometimes it is completely possible that the issue itself was us, 
because at the end of the day we are all capable of toxic traits, but the important 
thing is we address them and fix them.  

Finally, I wish this upon no one but if you do experience this, remember you can 
get through this. :)

Fin.
