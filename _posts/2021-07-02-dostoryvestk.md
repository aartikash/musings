There are times when we pick up books or buy books that we are never 
going to read. 

So the general question there is: How to read a book?

These two sentences might seem very much disconnected at the moment, 
but they are actually not. 

For the books that you know you are never going to read, the answer is 
quite simple, you don't need to know the how... right?

OK sorry, moving to more serious bit of the article:

Based on the books I have read I have categorised the books into the following things, 
now this is not complete in any way because honestly I don't remember most of the stuff
I have consumed... I have a huge memory loss. 

1. So if you are reading Fyodor Dos, or the standard classic novels: 
    1. Don't be hasty in reading such books, they require time and much introspection 
    2. So keep long block of months blocked for such books and read a bit everyday and then think about it and then 
    smile a little, if you want to. 
    3. Ocassionally go back a chapter or two and read them again and give a small laugh (again if you want to)

    Example: It took me 3 months to read Crime and Punishment and the day I finished that book I had become a totally 
    new person. But it was very interesting, because such books are not about the suspense or even the story, such 
    books are more about understanding different characters and the depth each character brings. 

2. If you are reading the top 100 best seller books from Goodreads suggestion. 
    1. Honestly, please don't read, they are mostly bullshit. 
    2. If you decide to not follow 1, and still go for them (I won't lie, I have read most of them), 
    skim those books, never read them because honestly they barely have any real content, quickly 
    read the first two pages of every chapter and understand what they are trying to say and move on. 


3. Non-fiction computer books
    1. So the general suggestion here would be (for any non-fiction book) please first do a background check on the 
    authors because these books are not fact-checked. 
    2. Now to read these books I usually start from the initial chapter, but I have noticed, that even if I don't 
    read it in a linear manner I am really able to understand what the book wants to say. 
    So I usually based on the content jump from different chapters and once I understand the author's writing style 
    I quickly read the book in a linear manner. 

4. Satire 
    1. These are some that I enjoy, I usually take time to read these books, I read a bit and then I play out what 
    I read before I move to the next bit.
    2. a good bit about these books is you don't have the incessant need to finish them quickly, you can do it at 
    your own pace. 
    3. Usually there arn't many charaters also that I have to keep up with so its cooler than the category 1 books above. 

5. Science fiction 
    1. SO this is tricky because I think these have to be read in a flow otherwise I usually stop following if I am reading 
    n books at the same time. 

6. Kafka sort of stuff
    1. Re read it, everytime it has something new to offer. 



Lesson: Why do you need someone to tell you how to read a book? Read how it suits you.
