It is one of the most difficult choices to chose a mentor in life. Especially when you have to chose an advisor for your Ph.D. program. The question that comes to mind is whom do I trust? Whom do I trust enough to guide me properly?

At this stage, I realized it does not matter. I only want to work with good people around me. The definition of good is quite subjective. However, for me, good means - to be genuinely interested in the general area of work we all as a community are striving towards, to be empathetic to people, to not expect tangible outcome every time (what does that even mean? - for new students learning is not always tangible), to not instill a notion of fear in humans around, a person who at least tries to be somewhat conscious of the bias they have and ofc should not be evil. Again evil is very subjective, however, I am striving towards a more general definition of evil. For eg. an advisor who does not lock you up in the lab until you finish your paper or maybe does not kill you if your writing was bad.  

Over the past 1.5 years as being a part of the academic community I have realized one very important thing. Area, type of research though quite important, another thing which is quite important is that you can connect with the person on something other than just work - a human connection which comes when both the parties respect each other. Keeping hierarchies aside it is important to respect the person you are working with. They are not anyone’s slaves or you are not anyone’s slave to be treated that way.

So coming back to the question, how to find the right mentor? - I cannot answer that question for everyone, it depends on whose presence makes you stable and comfortable. Mentors come in different shapes and forms. Sometimes we can learn more from those and that we never expected.

When it comes to finding a Ph.D. advisor there are no strict rules which I have read in articles all over the internet, such as hands-on, hands-off, full professor, assistant professor - No. I don’t believe these categories are legit in any way. You either connect with the human or you don’t. One person’s heaven might be another person’s poison. Hence, it is very important for every person to be actively aware about their poison. The problem is that the categories themselves are wrong. Approaching the problem of finding the advisor using these “standard-internet” categories is wrong. We as students and junior researchers need feedback from senior researchers to help us get to a level where we are able to see for ourselves if the problem statement is good or bad and take the right decisions. That is it. We as students are not kids, that we need someone to hold our hands and make us write codes. We are all here for the same purpose (at least in the ideal world) - to do research for the advancement of society and to rub our scientific curiosities. 

Therefore, I think at the end of the day, it is very important to find a professor whom you click with. A professor whose insight helps you in some way. A professor who is genuinely interested in research and not just in for the “professor perks”.

I think it is very difficult to find mentorship in one single person altogether. It is the entire community together which provides you mentorship in different contexts and it can come in different forms.
