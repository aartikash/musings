TO be fair, I have two twitter accounts, one is for "academia" garbage (that I have deactivated again)
and the other is the one where I follow stuff for random scrolling purposes. 

Since 2009, I have been sort of off from social media mostly because I 
realised in Grade 9 that if I read something I tend to not forget it and 
honestly sometimes the stuff humans post on social media is so fake and 
tailored that I can literally predict how they are going to reply to 
something. 

Anyway, the one thing that has been made very clear to me is that small 
communities are the most toxic ones here. 

The reason is they keep validating each other and normalising things that 
are... well not good. 

I think this notion of validation is the one that really mucks up things. 

Because someone with "status" is validating you, one tends to think I am not alone. 

I have noticed this especially in academia. 

Can something be done about this? -- Honestly, the only way to fix this is everyone 
starts thinking on their own and realising things on their own rather than 
relying on external validation or the fact that hey "blah blah" did this so 
me doing this is totally normal too or "blah blah" also suffered from this so 
me suffering from this is also totally normal.

Another problem with Twitter, I have noticed (again in context of academia), the 
same problems keep circling again and again and again and again. 
I mean...

Another observation is that, professors complain about the workload and the fact that 
conference reviews are painful. 
But, academia IS literally professors + students + admin that know not much about academia. 
I mean... 

The pay is less but it the professor that has control on how much a student can be paid. 
I mean... 


SO you see my point, these are all human created problems. 

Cycle: Create a problem that should not have been a problem -> Suffer that as a student -> Move on to a prof post and now suffer more
problems there -> The problems prof suffered put it out on students. 

Hahahaha. 

What is this? 

Fin.
