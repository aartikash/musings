So today I was trying to space travel to Kyoto. 

Unfortunately, I was not very successful. 

I think the problem that happened was that 
right now too many humans are space travelling 
and the time when I tried I think there was a lot 
of space traffic. 

It's alright though, I just need to find the right time 
to travel to Kyoto. 

I think there should be some timesheet in the space so when 
I start my travels I know when I can really really begin the 
travels. 

Lesson: Trust the timing.
