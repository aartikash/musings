  I have always been attracted to water. 
  This might now seem that I am just attracted to everything?
  But really I think water is really my first love. 

  When I was a kid all I wanted was to build a castle under the 
  water and stay there forever. 

  Lately I have been very conscious of the water that I have been 
  consuming. 
  This is when I started researching on water to understand what it 
  really us. 
  I learned in high school that the chemical formation of water is 
  H2O and that it can exist in three states gas, liquid and solid. 
  However, this information did not quench my thirst to learn about 
  water. (Did you notice what I did there?)

  Some things that I learned were that water tends to take on proeprties of 
  whatever it comes in contact with. 
  Apparently scientists conducted experiments where they showed that when a
  toxic substance vaccum sealed is kept in water, the water tends to 
  adapt the properties of that toxic substance too. 

  Another interesting thing about water is that since our body is composed 
  mostly of water, consuming "good quality" water becomes very important. 

  The water that we get from taps is mostly dead water and hence it is important
  that we store the water for a while in a decent container before drinking it. 
  I got myself a copper vessel so that I can purify the water that I consume.
  
  Other than that there have also been a lot of experiments that have been conducted
  where when water is treated with respect its structure changes and when it's 
  exposed to negative words again there are changes observed in the structure of water.
