description: Too much fun

<!--more-->


I think one of the biggest reasons that I really enjoy living in India is 
because we literally never run out of things to do, 

Everyday, all the time, there is something or the other that needs to be done. 

And everything is so different. 
Every work has so much... life. 

Today, I was setting up my room and we decided to do a havan. 
Now a havan is a ceremony where we take a metal container and 
add wood to it and burn the wood (specifically mango branches)
and also coal. 

When we light fire to it, we throw in a material that is called 
samagri and ghee. 
One humans adds samagri after a specific interval (usually that is me)
and one human adds ghee after specific interval (usually the other human, in 
this case it was my ma). 

I am glad someone enjoys doing these things on a regular basis with me. 

Finally, we do that for a while and then let the purity of the burning fire 
spread in the entire house. 

This is a thing that can never be done in North America because of their 
stupid alarms. 

I sat in that fire for about an hour. I literally feel so purified now. 

My eyes were watering for hours after that because I kept sitting in the room 
full of smoke (pure smoke though). 
My mom could not sit though with me in the room because she could not bear the smoke 
but I enjoyed it a lot so I sat alone until my mom forcefully pulled me out because 
she thought I will die in so much smoke and she did not want that. 

So much fun. 

I think everyone should do havan at home. 
When I buy my house in Canada (in the next 2 years for sure) I will 
have a room with no fire alarms so that I can do havan in peace. 

Fin.
