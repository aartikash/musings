Lately, I have been spending a huge chunk of my time at the bookstores. 
The bookstore that I spend my time is mostly Banyan books and sound. 
The reason I am so attracted to that bookstore is because of the energy that 
it holds within it. 

But that is not the main reason that I enjoy visiting that bookstore. 
I think the main reason is that local bookstores introduce me to new topics
that I was not really aware of. 
This differs from visiting standard university libraries, which work great for me
when I know exactly what genre and authors I am interested in reading. 
However, sometimes, I crave something new and that is when these local bookstores are
a treasure. 
They organise books based on different topics, there are humans who working/volunteering
at local bookstores that can help/suggest some interesting new things to explore. 
The reason this works better than the online applications for book suggestions such as Goodreads,
Likewise etc. is because the algorithms there seem to suggest the same set of 100-200 books. 
It's very difficult to get a very niche selection of unique books especially since the 100-200 books
prefer "popular" authors. I can write a compeletely seperate post about what popularity really means 
according to these applications but the general assumption can be white-men. 

Another really great bit of local bookstores is the ambiance since I do love the libraries but 
the overall setup of Banyan books and sound makes me feel neutral which is great.
I can pick my own corner, grab a couple of books and silently read without any disturbances. 
I usually like to sit on the floor and read instead of sitting inside a library on a proper 
table chair sort of thing. 
The music selection is also pretty calming and music has a very strong affect on me so it is very 
important that I resonate well with the sounds that are being played. 

Another great thing about the bookstore that I visit is its location, there are two great organic 
coffee places near it, there is a grocery store right next to it and the busstop is right in front of 
the bookstore from where I can board to head home and vice versa. 
I think this is a pretty great reason since I can quickly go grab a nice cup of coffee and go back
and sit in my bookstore and chill.
