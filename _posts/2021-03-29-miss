<!--more-->

So I am in the middle of packing my stuff and I realise 
I literally am discarding 90 percent of the stuff I own 
because seriously I am so lazy with packing and cleaning 
that I would rather put it in the dumpster than pack it. 

Well, I can have a complete new discussion on why am I 
like this? 

But friends that is not the focuus of this post. 

While packing I had a thought that what is the thing that I enjoy 
doing the most in the world. 

I realised my most favourite thing in the world is 
annoying humans. 

My sister sometimes shouts at me for doing this because 
without any warning I will randomly do things that I know 
for sure annoy humans and trigger them. 

I wish I could stop doing this but unfortunately I can't.

The one thing that comes naturally to me is flirting, with humans
doesn't matter the gender or age, animals, everything basically 
that exists.
