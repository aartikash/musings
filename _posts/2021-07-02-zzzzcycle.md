<!--more-->

When I reached Vancouver in 2018 the three things i immediately spent my money on 
was:
1. Cycle
2. Guitar 
3. Coffee

i had come in a month before the actual start of the term because I was abnormally 
excited to start and I wanted to know everything about UBC one possibly can. 

I spent the entire August 2018 visiting departments from neuroscience to what not 
and talking to everyone about their research. 

So it so happened that the bike kitchen dude from UBC became my friend because 
we had a common Tokyo connection. 
So understanding that I am a student and innocent, he gave me a pretty neat discount. 

So I had an awesome cycle for like 200 bucks. 

Unfortuantely, I had parked it outside the CS department and I was up in the lab working 
and when I came down, some one had already stolen my cycle. 
This happened one day before the term was about to start, I think 30th August. 

I sent dramatic messages to my friends in Vancouver, and they came and helped me search 
entire UBC for the cycle but we had lost it. 

So the next day I went and bought another cycle. 

Lesson: Not every story has a lesson, some are just emotional you know?
