So I was as usual sitting on my couch, come on guys, by now y'all must know 
what I am talking about. For those who don't I have a couch on which I usually
meditate, cry, eat, drink and ocassionally sleep. 

I think that I really enjoy explaining things in different ways and for my 
PhD I do read and use a lot of techie products and I think it is finally time to 
start a blog where I can share cool new things and write about them and hopefully 
help people. 

So why not use twitter for that stuff Aarti?
Well, for perhaps very random stuff twitter is great, but maybe sharing tools
and other things can be useful for humans if they want to access it I am not 
much interested in using twitter. 

Also, it is too much fast data for my cutie little brain at times. SO many humans
posting SO many things and thoughts, my brain completely crashes. 

So I think now I need a new badass template for a website for all projects and stuff. 

And yet again, I have found myself in the midst of the same battle that I keep fighting 
every few couple of months. 

Sometimes I wonder, why do same things keep repeating in my life? 
Will this repetition ever end?

Sometimes I want to be a beetle that is walking on the leaf for hours and hours, 
tripping and getting back up again. 

Yes, I want to be a beetle.
