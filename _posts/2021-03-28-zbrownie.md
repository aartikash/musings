I was having a discussion with one of my friends today about how awesome I am. 
Yes, sometimes I actually have those discussions because I get a little dizzy when 
I start thinking about how awesome I am and I need harcore grounding that very few 
humans in this specific dimension of the universe are capable of giving me. 

So a thought came in my head while having that conversation, which was, how does one 
know if they really really like something? I mean it can be a thing or a human or anything 
as a matter of fact. 

And that's when I realised, its our expressions when we look at that thing because otherwise
there is no real way to know. 

Since my first love is and will always (oops sorry second, my first love is me) be food, I found a pic 
of me looking at food and that is one of the most natural expressions I have ever had in a pic.

Lesson: FIND YOURSELF A THING THAT MAKES YOU LOOK AT IT THE WAY I LOOK AT FOOD FRIENDS. 

Bye for now. Hope this helps.

of PCOS.
