Like most things in this universe, coffee is yet another thing that I have always loved. 

I have the tools to make the best coffee in my house and yet,
I chose to spend 6$ on a coffee?

I get my coffee powder all the way from Montreal with different, beautiful, subtle 
flavourings every month and yet, 
I chose to spend 6$ on a coffee?

I have a proper vietnemese filter that allows me to make the 
absolutely delicious and smooth coffee with hot milk and yet, 
I chose to spend  6$ on a coffee?

I have cracked the code of the correct water to coffee ratio for making the decoction and yet, 
I chose to spend 6$ on a coffee?

I have understood the milk to decoction ratio to get the absolutely creamy flavouring and yet, 
I chose to spend 6$ on a coffee?

I have proper cutlery to support my fancies and yet, 
I chose to spend 6$ on a coffee?

I am good at handling my finances and understand how overrated things are in this world and yet,
I chose to spend 6$ on a coffee?

I really really enjoy the entire process of making and drinking coffee at home and yet, 
I chose to spend 6$ on a coffee?

Yet another lesson my friends:
Well, like I have said before, we all do things we don't understand and yet we do it. 
Sometimes its ok to not understand things and just do them if they make use feel good. 

I would rather not have an answer to this question than an answer that forcefully fits an answer. 

I want to so I chose to spend 6$ on a coffee and that is the best answer for me. 

Thanks for reading and hope this helps you all.
