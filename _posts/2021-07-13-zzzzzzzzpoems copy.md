So my best bro today told me he feels blessed to have me in 
his life because of my amazing humour. 

I did try to act a little modest when he said that but then 
I decided why pretend when you know the truth. 

So well, some reasons I think I have such a great sense of humour is 
1. It's my sophisticated language, and great use of words 
2. It's my perfect grammar that brings out the words even more. 
3. It's my ability to speak the truth 
4. It is my observation skills, I mean if you look at my Finds article, it 
really shows the depths I am willing to go for humour. 

I cannot really express in words how to have a great sense of humour but 
I think everyone has it somewhere deep within them. 

The courage lies in the ability to go into your truth and speak it out loud. 

Lesson: You can also have a great sense of humour if you have enough courage. 







Fin.
