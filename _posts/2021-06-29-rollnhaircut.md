Since the pandemic is now starting to slow down a bit, 
with new variants coming in every day in India (the current 
one is called delta+) I have now started going out and chilling. 

I think the thing that I enjoy the most is driving especially 
driving in India. 
It is like this unpredictable game because the signals are mostly crappy
and a lot of roads are quite disastrous so it is like playing a game 
where if you lose you might actually die lol. 

So I finally went for a haircut today which took I think approx 2 hours or 
something because we (the haircut dude and I) started experimenting with my 
hair. 
He was bored with giving everyone the same haircut, I was open to trying out 
any thing that so we totally went all in. 

This resulted in me having the coolest haircut that one can ever imagine in the 
history of haircuts. 
I literally could not stop looking at me because I look so amazing. 

So after that I decided to have a kolkata role from the shop next door. 

Lesson: Never trust the titles. They can be misleading. HAHAH.

Fin.
