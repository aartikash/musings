<div class="well">
    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Hello, I am me.</p>
    <p> That said, please don't anything I say here to your heart, i have a wierd way of communicating deep and scary 
       messages that might trivialise the problem a bit too much and make complicated emotions sound very simple.
       
       My existance superpower is to trivialise even the most complicated thing in the world and I use it for everything 
       I do in life.
